/*!
     This is the class used to perform all SDK tasks.

     Terminology:
     - <b>User</b>: the user that is using the app on the device.
     - <b>VIC</b>: the campaign identification, also called "Integration Code". Find it on your Merchant page/Products, the item "Get integration code" under every campaign.
     - <b>SID</b>: an unique device user identification. Its preferably provided by you, but can be generated by Trialpay.
     - <b>Touchpoint</b>: identifies the button that was clicked to open the Offer Wall - the name is your choice.


     @see <a href="http://help.trialpay.com/mobile/ios-sdk">Integrating the TrialPay SDK into an iOS app</a>
