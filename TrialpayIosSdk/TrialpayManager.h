    Trialpay iOS SDK API Reference Documentation.

    Thanks for using Trialpay!

    Follow the @ref SampleIntegration or browse through the @ref TrialpayManager for details on each API feature.

     @see <a href="http://help.trialpay.com/mobile/ios-sdk">Integrating the TrialPay SDK into an iOS app</a>

     @page SampleIntegration Sample Integration

 

In your Interface Builder
 1. Create a UIButton that will allow to open the Offer Wall
 2. Create a TpDealspotView element
 
In your view controller header
@code
 
...
#import "TrialpayManager.h"
...
@interface MyViewController : UIViewController <TrialpayManagerDelegate>
...
- (IBAction)openOfferwallWithSender:(id)sender;
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet TpDealspotView *dealspotView;
 
@endcode

In your view controller module
@code
 
...
@implementation MyViewController
- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Load the Trialpay Manager object
    TrialpayManager* trialpayManager = [TrialpayManager getInstance];
    // Set the user id. Not required if you are using Balance API
    [trialpayManager setSid:@"<UNIQUE_USER_ID>"];
    // Register the Offer Wall touchpoint
    [trialpayManager registerVic:@"<OFFERWALL_INTEGRATION_CODE_FROM_TRIALPAY>" withTouchpoint:@"<YOUR_OFFERWALL_TOUCHPOINT_NAME>"];
    // Set the DealSpot touchpoint
    [trialpayManager registerVic:@"<DEALSPOT_INTEGRATION_CODE_FROM_TRIALPAY>" withTouchpoint:@"<YOUR_DEALSPOT_TOUCHPOINT_NAME>"];
    [self.dealspotView setTouchpointName:@"dealspot"];
    // Initiate Balance API checks. Not needed if you accept callbacks to your server
    [trialpayManager initiateBalanceChecks];
    // Get responses from Trialpay
    [trialpayManager setDelegate:self];
}

// Associate this IBAction with the button that triggers the Offer Wall
- (IBAction)openOfferwallWithSender:(id)sender
{
    TrialpayManager *trialpayManager = [TrialpayManager getInstance];
    [trialpayManager openTouchpoint:@"<YOUR_OFFERWALL_TOUCHPOINT_NAME>"];
}

// Listen to TrialPay's balance updates if you're using the Balance API
- (void)trialpayManager:(TrialpayManager *)trialpayManager balanceWasUpdatedForTouchpoint:(NSString*)touchpointName
{
  int balanceToAdd = [trialpayManager withdrawBalanceForTouchpoint:touchpointName];
  // TODO: Add the balanceToAdd amount to the user's credits
}

// Optional: Listen to TrialPay's Close event
- (void)trialpayManager:(TrialpayManager *)trialpayManager offerwallDidCloseForTouchpoint:(NSString*)touchpointName 
{
  // TODO: Implement
}
 
 
...

@page AdvancedIntegration Advanced Integration
Passing the following values will improve TrialPay's monetization for your app
 
Demographic information
---
Call this code when the app loads the user information
@code
 [[TrialpayManager getInstance] setAge:userAge];
 [[TrialpayManager getInstance] setGender:userGender];
@endcode

User's progress
---
Every time the user goes into a new level, call the method below.
@code
 [[TrialpayManager getInstance] updateLevel:level];
@endcode
For this scope, level is the numerical ordered value that correlates with the experience that the user gained in the game.
Not sure what the value should be? Ask us.
 
Virtual Currency gaining
---
When users are granted with virtual currency as a result of a purchse, offer based earning or a gifting event in the app, call the following method:
@code
 [[TrialpayManager getInstance] updateVcPurchaseInfoForTouchpoint:@"<TOUCHPOINT_FOR_VC>" dollarAmount:dollarAmount vcAmount:vcAmount];
@endcode
Note:
 1. Pass only dollar amount
 2. If a user gets VC for free, pass 0 as the dollar amount
 3. Call this method even when the credit event was done through TrialPay:
@code
// Listen to Trialpay' balance updates if you're using the Balance API
- (void)trialpayManager:(TrialpayManager *)trialpayManager balanceWasUpdatedForTouchpoint:(NSString*)touchpointName {
  int balanceToAdd = [trialpayManager withdrawBalanceForTouchpoint:touchpointName];
  [trialpayManager updateVcPurchaseInfoForTouchpoint:touchpointName dollarAmount:0 vcAmount:balanceToAdd];
  // TODO: Add the balanceToAdd amount to the user's credits
}
@endcode
 
Update current Virtual Currency state
---
Call this method with the same value that would appear on the screen for the user.
@code
 [[TrialpayManager getInstance] updateVcBalanceForTouchpoint:@"<TOUCHPOINT_FOR_VC>" vcAmount:vcAmount];
@endcode
Note:
 1. The vcAmount is not an incremental change - it is the current Virtual Currency value. It is recommended to call it on the same method that updates the value on the screen.
 2. Calling updateVcPurchaseInfoForTouchpoint:dollarAmount:vcAmount: does not update the balance.

Custom Parameters
---
If you're using the callback method and created a custom parameter on the merchant panel, use the code below in order to set the custom parameter:
@code
// Associate this IBAction with the button that triggers the Offer Wall
- (IBAction)openOfferwallWithSender:(id)sender {
  TrialpayManager *trialpayManager = [TrialpayManager getInstance];
  [trialpayManager setCustomParamValue:@"custom_param_value" forName:@"my_custom_parameter";];
  [trialpayManager openTouchpoint:@"<YOUR_OFFERWALL_TOUCHPOINT_NAME>"];
}
@endcode
Note: the custom parameter value is being reset after opening the Offer Wall

/*!
     This is the class used to perform all SDK tasks.

     Terminology:
     - <b>User</b>: the user that is using the app on the device.
     - <b>VIC</b>: the campaign identification, also called "Integration Code". Find it on your Merchant page/Products, the item "Get integration code" under every campaign.
     - <b>SID</b>: an unique device user identification. Its preferably provided by you, but can be generated by Trialpay.
     - <b>Touchpoint</b>: identifies the button that was clicked to open the Offer Wall - the name is your choice.
